## My process

I start over with body display as flex in order to quick postioning for the main container at center.The main container displayed as grid in order to reach the perfect boxing for those objects inside.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned lot of informations about grid system and that I can put grid inside flexbox .I descover a way in html to make icons but i don't know yet how i make an icon with this element (svg).

### Continued development

Iam looking forward to learn more about postioning objects as mos of time i use margin and padding to place an object at it's right postion.
Also I want to learn about (svg) in html how it works and when I use it .

### Useful resources
